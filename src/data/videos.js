It differs from native classes because it cannot be mutated after it's creation and it <em>always</em> has a default value. It's an excellent construct in which to piece together your stores, be them Flux or some other storage implementation. Let's quickly create an Immutable Record().",

    "description": "While Immutable.js offers .is() to confirm value equality between iterables it comes at the cost of referencing each key and value in both objects. For lightning fast equality checks, Immutable.js can produce a hash code based on an iterable's content. If two iterables have the same content, their hash codes will be the same. It's worth noting that this technique is unsuitable for mission critical application development since there is a chance, however slight, that checksums like these might collide. This is outlined here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)</a>",

The concept is simple: reduce transforms your iterable into something else, that's all. The name is misleading as you may or may not actually \"reduce\" anything. Let's replicate the groupBy() and filter() methods with reduce to illustrate how it works.",
